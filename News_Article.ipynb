Freshly laid off from my job of 19 years as a TV producer, I was the perfect candidate for Oprah's The Life You Want Weekend. I was canned from my job August 7 while on vacation so I decided to say yes to every opportunity and reconnect with old colleagues and friends while on sabbatical. By chance, I met my old friend Julie with whom I worked 15 years ago. We used to watch Oprah at 4pm each day at work. We looked important because we worked in TV and had headphones on so people thought we were actually working. So Julie and I went for a walk, and at the end of the walk she mentioned she had an extra ticket to the Oprah odyssey and I of course jumped at the chance to go. I then went home and furiously plotted, begged, borrowed, and stole Saturday carpools to be able to be present on Friday night and all day Saturday at the Oprahpalooza! So Julie and I (Julie 2.0) met up Friday night at the workshop. Little did I know she had third row seats on the floor of the Verizon Center. I could spit on Oprah. And yes she is the happy, heavier Oprah we all know and love. Of course I have watched too many Oprah shows and immediately when I sat down I felt underneath my chair for the keys to a new car. Sadly they were not there. So now it is Friday night at the Verizon Center and I'm waiting for Oprah to inspire me. She rose out of the stage a few feet away and joked that, while she could not sing or dance, almost the entire Verizon center was sold out to hear her speak on a Friday night. Mostly women, skewing on the more African American scale but not by much, multi-generational women there to be inspired on what they should do with their lives. We held hands, danced together, and laughed. So much estrogen wanting to know how to be guided and to find our dream job. Oprah lesson one is that \\\"the universe delivers what you put out there\\\". So basic yet true! If you are positive, positive things will come back to you. This message is followed by \\\"you cannot manage other folks\\\". So do not go there, wasted energy, focus only on yourself. Finally \\\"you co-create your life, so manage it as you want to live it\\\". It sounds corny now but we had these bracelets on that lit up in colors that correlated to the mood you were feeling. She inspired us all, made us laugh- she is really quite funny - and we all loved the night. I felt like Oprah was my BFF, my sister. I held hands with strangers next to me. Her final takeaway that night was an intimate moment she shared about her grandmother who raised her. As her grandmother got older she explained that one day she hoped Oprah would be as lucky as she was and work for nice white folks. This family was kind to her grandma with money, and donated clothes and food and only hoped Oprah could have the same thing. Oprah rounded out the night thanking us all for being her white folks. So very powerful, we all left on a high! I had an epiphany during her talk that life is too short to be unhappy. I was inspired enough when I got home I told my husband, Mark, he should quit his job on Monday. Thanks Oprah! Oops, now we are both unemployed. I'm back in my chair on Saturday morning by 8 am. This is the day we are rolling up our sleeves and figuring out the life we want. Oprah strolls out on stage right in front of me wearing jeans and a blue sweater and glasses and is ready to be the teacher. We have worksheets to finish the day and she is going to moderate us through the exercises. So we begin by picturing someone we love and writing down what we wish they would do to succeed and be happy. Of course I pick my husband, who hates his job, and proceed to cry like a baby as I write down what I want for him. The cameras filming the event seize on me and I continue to cry outright; thankfully Julie ignores my very blatant tears and slides a tissue my way. It being all women in the crowd mostly, Oprah explains eventually we need to do the same exercise for ourselves. Women never do that for themselves. We fill out a pie chart on how we rank our lives--I spaced out and fill out 75% of mine to include family and friends and then pencil the other areas in like job, health, hobbies, spirituality, financial situation and the contribution to the world, and they all only get a teeny piece of the pie because hey that is the truth of a mom with 4 kids! I clearly need to start balancing out the pie with a few more slices for me. Then Oprah fills hers out on the big techno screen and she only rates her job a small portion of her pie chart. Shocking considering she had her own talk show for 25 years and owns her own TV network. But Oprah's financial situation pie slice had a gazillion smileys--mine had two. Saturday continued with inspired talks from Liz Gilbert, author ofEat, Pray, Lovewho encouraged everyone to find their inner quest. We all have that dream dormant or ready to conquest. Now that I am unemployed - as will be my husband Mark come October 3 thanks to Oprah - we are so very tempted to take a memorable trip but we have a high school teenager too. So sadly it will not happen. I think the most inspirational speaker for me during the two days was a young pastor named Rob Bell, a hip 30-something man with a gift for story telling without the religious connotations. His message was what a miracle it is to be alive and have a conscientious choice. In the end, none of us know our 2.0 and are just trying to figure it out. I change my plan every day. Oprah says everyone of us is looking for the same thing - we want to know we matter! And everyone has a story to tell, I just may not know mine yet. Thanks for reading oh and yikes I have a job interview this coming week. Game on Oprah!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

months ago by his office. as a part of the pilot program, the brooklyn da\\u2019s office, according to gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201ci believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d gonzalez said. \\u201csince 2014, the brooklyn da\\u2019s office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does

at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 national survey on drug use and health. a new york times analysis published sunday revealed that in new york city, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. the rates were even worse in manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. the manhattan da\\u2019s office findings echoed the times\\u2019

referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. a recently closed group exhibition at david zwirner gallery in new york city, titled \\\"system and vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  the show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. what ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n chris hipkiss, forget the sun, 2012, mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. as artreview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" last year david zwirner himself came in at no. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer larry gagosian, moma director glenn lowry and jeff koons, among many, many others. all of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. so where does that put \\\"system and vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like yayoi kusama, richard serra and dan flavin? let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with delmes & zander, a gallery based in germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n william crawford, untitled, 1990s, pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. this particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. one such erotically inclined artist is william crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in oakland, california. many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. the frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. the pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. amersand gallery describes crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n morton bartlett, untitled, ca. 1950, vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  an even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of morton bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. between 1936 and 1960 bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  the dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"they project childish innocence,\\\" ken johnson wrote for the boston globe, \\\"but in bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  although there's some level of desire pulsing through bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. in \\\"how to look at outsider art,\\\" lyle rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of edgar degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. for rexer, bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"they take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n type 42 (anonymous), star trek, 1960s-1970s, mixed media on polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 polaroids referred to as type 42, capturing the expressions of television, b-movie and sci-fi actresses. the dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"the survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. the viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" david zwirner gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. an artist known as prophet royal robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. his piece \\\"the day the world end\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with god as a driver. memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. his works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n prophet royal robertson, the day the world end, 1990s, ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. it's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. however, david zwirner gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" possibly, in part, because after showing at zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. as the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"system and vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. the emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  it would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. that's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. however, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  as the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"system and vision\\\" could be a step forward. as could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term \\\"outsider art\\\" nor another alternative. it's unusual to see a name like william crawford alongside alice neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. hopefully one day it won't be.\\r\\n type 42 (anonymous), carroll baker, 1960s-1970s, mixed media on polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes &

months ago by his office. as a part of the pilot program, the brooklyn da\\u2019s office, according to gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201ci believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d gonzalez said. \\u201csince 2014, the brooklyn da\\u2019s office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does

at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 national survey on drug use and health. a new york times analysis published sunday revealed that in new york city, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. the rates were even worse in manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. the manhattan da\\u2019s office findings echoed the times\\u2019

referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. a recently closed group exhibition at david zwirner gallery in new york city, titled \\\"system and vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  the show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. what ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n chris hipkiss, forget the sun, 2012, mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. as artreview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" last year david zwirner himself came in at no. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer larry gagosian, moma director glenn lowry and jeff koons, among many, many others. all of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. so where does that put \\\"system and vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like yayoi kusama, richard serra and dan flavin? let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with delmes & zander, a gallery based in germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n william crawford, untitled, 1990s, pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. this particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. one such erotically inclined artist is william crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in oakland, california. many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. the frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. the pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. amersand gallery describes crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n morton bartlett, untitled, ca. 1950, vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  an even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of morton bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. between 1936 and 1960 bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  the dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"they project childish innocence,\\\" ken johnson wrote for the boston globe, \\\"but in bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  although there's some level of desire pulsing through bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. in \\\"how to look at outsider art,\\\" lyle rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of edgar degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. for rexer, bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"they take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n type 42 (anonymous), star trek, 1960s-1970s, mixed media on polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 polaroids referred to as type 42, capturing the expressions of television, b-movie and sci-fi actresses. the dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"the survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. the viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" david zwirner gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. an artist known as prophet royal robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. his piece \\\"the day the world end\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with god as a driver. memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. his works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n prophet royal robertson, the day the world end, 1990s, ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. it's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. however, david zwirner gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" possibly, in part, because after showing at zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. as the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"system and vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. the emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  it would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. that's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. however, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  as the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"system and vision\\\" could be a step forward. as could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term \\\"outsider art\\\" nor another alternative. it's unusual to see a name like william crawford alongside alice neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. hopefully one day it won't be.\\r\\n type 42 (anonymous), carroll baker, 1960s-1970s, mixed media on polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes &

effect on aug. 1., comes after the da\\u2019s office spent\\u00a0six months analyzing places in the united states where marijuana has been decriminalized.\\u00a0 \\u201cthe dual mission of the manhattan d.a.\\u2019s office is a safer new york and a more equal justice system,\\u201d vance said in a press release. \\u201cthe ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown new yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.\\u201d the manhattan da\\u2019s office is working with mayor bill de blasio and the new york police commissioner to establish when exceptions to the new policy might be necessary. de blasio hinted at the policy change\\u00a0during a conference earlier tuesday,\\u00a0announcing that the new york police department would \\u201coverhaul\\u201d its policies on enforcing marijuana cases in the next 30 days. i'm announcing today that the nypd will overhaul its marijuana enforcement policies in the next 30 days. we must end unnecessary arrests and end disparity in enforcement. brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez also asserted his stance on marijuana cases tuesday by highlighting a pilot program launched three months ago by his office. as a part of the pilot program, the brooklyn da\\u2019s office, according to gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201ci believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d gonzalez said. \\u201csince 2014, the brooklyn da\\u2019s office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does not adversely affect public safety.\\u201d statement by brooklyn da eric gonzalez regarding handling of marijuana arrests: pic.twitter.com/u6a3rkqpdh tuesday\\u2019s announcements suggest that new york \\u2015\\u00a0a state currently exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana altogether, as other states have \\u2015\\u00a0is starting to more forcefully tackle the disproportionate rates at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 national survey on drug use and health. a new york times analysis published sunday revealed that in new york city, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. the rates were even worse in manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. the manhattan da\\u2019s office findings echoed the times\\u2019 research.\\u00a0 noting the racial disparity of marijuana arrests, the manhattan da\\u2019s office said tuesday\\u00a0that \\u201clarge numbers of new yorkers become further alienated from law enforcement and removed from community participation at an enormous cost to the criminal justice system, for virtually no punitive, rehabilitative or deterrent purpose.\\u201d\",\n

referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. a recently closed group exhibition at david zwirner gallery in new york city, titled \\\"system and vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  the show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. what ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n chris hipkiss, forget the sun, 2012, mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. as artreview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" last year david zwirner himself came in at no. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer larry gagosian, moma director glenn lowry and jeff koons, among many, many others. all of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. so where does that put \\\"system and vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like yayoi kusama, richard serra and dan flavin? let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with delmes & zander, a gallery based in germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n william crawford, untitled, 1990s, pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. this particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. one such erotically inclined artist is william crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in oakland, california. many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. the frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. the pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. amersand gallery describes crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n morton bartlett, untitled, ca. 1950, vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  an even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of morton bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. between 1936 and 1960 bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  the dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"they project childish innocence,\\\" ken johnson wrote for the boston globe, \\\"but in bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  although there's some level of desire pulsing through bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. in \\\"how to look at outsider art,\\\" lyle rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of edgar degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. for rexer, bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"they take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n type 42 (anonymous), star trek, 1960s-1970s, mixed media on polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 polaroids referred to as type 42, capturing the expressions of television, b-movie and sci-fi actresses. the dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"the survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. the viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" david zwirner gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. an artist known as prophet royal robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. his piece \\\"the day the world end\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with god as a driver. memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. his works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n prophet royal robertson, the day the world end, 1990s, ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes & zander (berlin + cologne)  often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. it's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. however, david zwirner gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" possibly, in part, because after showing at zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. as the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"system and vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. the emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  it would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. that's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. however, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  as the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"system and vision\\\" could be a step forward. as could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term \\\"outsider art\\\" nor another alternative. it's unusual to see a name like william crawford alongside alice neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. hopefully one day it won't be.\\r\\n type 42 (anonymous), carroll baker, 1960s-1970s, mixed media on polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), courtesy galerie susanne zander / delmes &
